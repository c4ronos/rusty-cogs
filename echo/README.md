# INFO
---
➥ This cog is heavily inspired by Carl-bot's `echo`
<br /> <br/>
➥ Using this cog through slash commands is recommended.
<br /> <br/>
➥ If done so, otheres will not be able to see who ran the echo command, just like Carl-bot.

# USAGE
---
➥ Recommended: `/echo` but the option to use it as `[p]echo` is also given.
