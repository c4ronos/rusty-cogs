### Supports slash commands
<h1></h1>

# INFO
---
➥ Someone is meatriding? Use this cog to send a random meatrider image pointed at them.
<br/> <br/>
➥ This cog has handpicked memes being stored on an image hosting service.

# USAGE
---
➥ `meatrider <user>` or `meatrider <user> del`.
<br/> <br/>
➥ Bot will delete the author's original message if `del` is written, thus hiding who ran the command. (Executing through slash commands uses this logic by default - hiding who ran the slash command.)

# NOTE
---
➥ If you have *high quality* meatrider meme(s), you can contact me through the ways mentioned in the repository's main README and i will add them to the cog.
