### Supports slash commands

# INFO
---
➥ Have opposing views on moderating a user? This cog solves that using a vote system.
<br/><br/>
➥ This starts a vote to ban/kick/mute a user. Bot will add a checkmark and a cross reaction on an embed stating the action.
<br/> <br/>
➥ If the required no. of votes (default=5) is met, the bot will kick/ban/mute the user. It will stop the action if the cross emoji gets the required no. of votes before the checkmark.

# USAGE
---
➥ [ OPTIONAL ] Start by setting up the no. of votes required using `voteset` command (skip if you're happy if the default number i.e. `5`). I suggest changing this based on the number of members you have in your server.
<br/> <br/>
➥ After setup simply run `voteban <user>` or `votekick <user>` or `votemute <user>`.
